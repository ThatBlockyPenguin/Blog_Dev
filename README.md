# Blog (Dev)

This repository holds the development (staging) platform for my blog.
When I decide that it is ready to go live, all files in [./docs](./docs) get pushed to [Blog_Production](https://github.com/ThatBlockyPenguin/Blog_Production), where they are served at https://blog.blockypenguin.com.
