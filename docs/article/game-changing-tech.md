# **Game-Changing Tech: How Current and Emerging Technologies are Shaping the Future of Gaming**

{% include published.html date="2nd March 2023" %}

## What is the Computer Gaming industry?

The computer gaming industry is a multi-billion pound industry that has evolved significantly since the first recognised computer game called _Spacewar!_ in 1962. Today, it consists of three key parts: developers, publishers, and players. {% include refpointer.html id=2 %}

Game developers are the creative minds behind computer games, designing and building games, characters, and storylines. Some of the most influential developers include Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Mojang Studios.

Publishers are responsible for bringing the games to market, providing funding, marketing, and distribution. Revenue in the gaming industry is projected to reach $365.6 billion US dollars in 2023 and has seen significant growth in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. {% include refpointer.html id=3 %}

## What Social and Technological trends have occurred in Computer Gaming?

### Genres

A genre is how something (such as a computer game) can be categorised. A genre, in computer gaming, describes: {% include refpointer.html id=4 %}

- The style of play
- The types of challenges
- The perspective of the player

Some popular types of genre for computer games are: {% include refpointer.html id=4 %}

#### Action games

Action games are characterised by fast-paced gameplay with a focus on mobility, combat, hand-eye coordination, and reaction time. {% include refpointer.html id=5 %}

Any game in which the majority of tasks are physical tests of skill falls under the action genre. Other challenges, such as races or collecting things, can occasionally be included in action games, although they are not core to the genre. {% include refpointer.html id=5 %}

#### Adventure games

Adventure games often have few or no action features and focus on puzzle solving within a narrative framework. The definition of "adventure" in the dictionary does not necessarily apply to adventure games. Some are, but many forego risk and thrill in favour of more peaceful, introspective pursuits. {% include refpointer.html id=6 %}

A narrative, puzzles, and exploration are common aspects in adventure games. {% include refpointer.html id=6 %}

#### Role-playing games (RPGs)

A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which each player plays the role of a character, usually in a fantasy or science fiction setting, which they may interact with inside the game's fictitious world. {% include refpointer.html id=7 %}

Because of the variety of sub-genres with RPG features, defining RPGs is extremely difficult. {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

Traditional role-playing video games had five fundamental elements: {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

- The ability to upgrade your character throughout the course of the game by raising their statistics or levels.
- A menu-based combat system featuring a variety of abilities, spells, and attacks.
- An inventory system that allows for the use/storage of items like armour and weapons.
- A main mission that runs across the game as a plot, as well as supplemental (and typically optional) side quests.
- The capacity to interact with parts of the environment or plot via abilities such as lockpicking, disarming traps, communication, et al.
- Character classes exist to determine a character's attributes, talents, abilities, and spells (e.g. wizard, thief, warrior, etc.)

Modern RPGs typically incorporate one or two of these aspects in conjunction with elements from another genre. {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

#### Simulation games

Simulation games are typically designed to closely resemble real-world activity. A simulation game seeks to replicate diverse activities from real life in the form of a game for various goals such as training, analysis, prediction, or entertainment. Often, there are no clearly stated goals in the game, and the user is free to manipulate a character or environment. {% include refpointer.html id=9 %}

#### Strategy games

Strategy games prioritise thought and preparation above immediate action as the means of success. Although many other types of video games can have strategic components, strategy games as a genre are most typically characterised as those with a major focus on high-level strategy, logistics, and resource management. They are generally often split into two major sub-genres: turn-based and real-time, although there are several strategy sub-genres that include extra components such as tactics, diplomacy, economy, and exploration. {% include refpointer.html id=10 %}

#### Sports games

Sports games are recreations of physical sports. Tennis, football, boxing, and motor racing are just a few examples of sports that also exist in video game form. {% include refpointer.html id=11 %}

Some sports games have a focus on actively participating in the sport, while others place an emphasis on strategy and organisation. For humorous effect, some satirise the sport. This genre, like real-world sports, has been popular throughout the history of video games. A number of game series use the names and attributes of real teams and players, and they are updated on a regular basis to match real-world developments. {% include refpointer.html id=11 %}

#### Puzzle games

Puzzle games focus on logical and intellectual obstacles, although they frequently include time-pressure or other action components. Although many action or adventure games include puzzles, such as collecting difficult-to-reach things, a true puzzle game emphasises problem solving as the core gameplay mechanic. Games typically contain shapes, colours, or symbols that the player must manipulate directly or indirectly into a specified pattern. {% include refpointer.html id=12 %}

Puzzle games often show a sequence of similar puzzles that are variations on a same idea. This might entail pattern recognition, logic, or understanding a process. These games often feature a straightforward set of rules in which players manipulate game pieces on a grid, network, or other interaction area. {% include refpointer.html id=12 %}

#### Idle games

In an idle game, players perform basic activities, such as clicking a button, which earns them in-game currency. The currency may be spent to buy equipment or skills that allow the player to acquire the currency more quickly or automatically without having to do the first activity. {% include refpointer.html id=13 %}

A recurring topic is providing the player with sources of money represented by structures such as factories or farms. These sources improve the pace of currency gain, however higher tier sources generally have an exponentially greater cost, therefore upgrading between tiers usually takes the same amount of time or even longer. {% include refpointer.html id=13 %}

This provides an environment with no way to “lose”, low-pressure (as you do not have to play constantly to succeed), and steady progress and feedback, which is ideal for social or mobile play patterns and typically provides high levels of player retention. {% include refpointer.html id=13 %}

### Sub-Genres

Advances in technology and game design have had a significant influence on gaming, creating sub-genres within (frequently overlapping) genres. Some sub-genres can even be seen as sub-genres of sub-genres! {% include refpointer.html id=4 %}

#### Massive Multiplayer Online Game (MMO) / Massive Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game (MMORPG)

An MMO is a game in which many people may play together at the same time over the internet. These games are typically played in a social context, which the user may access after installing the game. {% include refpointer.html id=14 %}

An MMORPG, as the name implies, is a form of MMO which belongs to the [RPG genre](#role-playing-games-rpgs). {% include refpointer.html id=15 %}

By definition, an MMORPG is both an MMO and an RPG, whereas MMOs can be anything from a Battle Royale game to a real-time strategy game, or anything else - as long as it fits the MMO category. {% include refpointer.html id=15 %}

#### Real-time Strategy (RTS)

In Real-time strategy games, players construct troops and defeat their opponents by using resources and skill. Real-time strategy games are usually compared to turn-based strategy games, in which each player has time to carefully consider their next move without being concerned about the moves of their opponent, as each player makes their move on their turn. Real-time strategy games however, allow all players to play simultaneously, with players gathering resources, defending their bases, and launching attacks while being aware that their opponent is doing the same. and may attack at any time. {% include refpointer.html id=16 %}

#### Sandbox

A sandbox game is one in which the player has few constraints, allowing them to freely traverse and modify a virtual world. In contrast to a progression-style game, a sandbox game emphasises exploration and lets the player select tasks. A sandbox game often takes place in a "world" to which the player has total access from beginning to end, rather than separated areas or numbered levels. {% include refpointer.html id=17 %}

Players may choose whether or not to explore structured components of the game, such as mini-games, quests, and storylines. Oftentimes, the non-sequential nature of sandbox games presents game designers with many narrative challenges. As a result, tasks and side-quests often follow a pattern, with tasks unlocking upon successful completion of other objectives. {% include refpointer.html id=17 %}

#### First-Person Shooter (FPS)

A first-person shooter game is played from the protagonist's point of view. during gameplay, the character's arms are normally seen at the bottom of the screen, carrying whatever item is equipped. {% include refpointer.html id=18 %}

Most FPS games have added realism features, such as the rocking of the screen to represent natural human movement, breathing sounds, and footsteps. {% include refpointer.html id=18 %}

#### Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)

A MOBA is a form of highly competitive video game in which two teams of players compete against each other in a battle arena. Each player has control of a single character, each with their own set of talents and skills, and generally, work together to demolish the opponent team's base while defending their own. {% include refpointer.html id=19 %}

The gameplay often includes defeating opponent troops and structures to collect in-game currency, which can then be used to enhance abilities and purchase items. Each player's character has a class, such as a tank, a healer, or an archer, and teams normally include a good mix of these roles to form a balanced lineup. As the game progresses, team fights become more intense and players become stronger, leading to an exciting and challenging gaming experience. {% include refpointer.html id=19 %}

They require players to think on their feet, work together with their team, and make quick decisions, making them an engaging and immersive gaming experience. {% include refpointer.html id=19 %}

#### Battle Royale

A battle royale game is a type of online multiplayer game that features last-man-standing gameplay with certain aspects of a survival game, such as exploration and scavenging. Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players who start with limited equipment and must eliminate all opponents while avoiding getting trapped outside of a diminishing "safe region." The winner is the last player or team standing. {% include refpointer.html id=20 %}

#### Action-Adventure

As the name suggests, action-adventure games combine features from both action games and adventure games. They involve physical skills commonly seen in action games, but also include narrative elements such as compelling storylines, multiple characters, dialogue, and an inventory system that are typically found in adventure games. As a result, playing action-adventure games presents the player with both combat and logic-testing challenges. The gameplay in action-adventure games is typically more intense than pure adventure games, and players typically control a single avatar as the protagonist. These games can be categorized into different types such as first-person action-adventure, third-person action-adventure, platform-adventure games, stealth games, and survival games. {% include refpointer.html id=21 %}

### Types of Gamer

Research has been done to identify the different types of computer gamers that exist. It found that there were 5 main types, categorisable into “potentially problematic” and “non-problematic”. {% include refpointer.html id=22 %}

#### Recreational Gamer

- Has low impulsivity
- Has high self-esteem
- Generally spends less time gaming overall
- Finds gaming more of a hobby and not something they *have* to do
- Gaming is just an activity that they enjoy

#### Social Gamer

- Non-problematic
- Has low impulsivity
- May have low self-esteem
- Plays for the social experience and role-playing potential
- Doesn't find themselves needing to play out of compulsion
- Likely enjoys creating virtual characters but not as a means to replace their real-life identity

#### The ‘Escaper’

- Potentially Problematic
- Seeks to relieve negative mood states through gaming
- Highly motivated by immersive gameplay for its escapism
- May have poor self-esteem
- Less sensation-seeking
- Highly impulsive traits
- Gaming may be as a means to cope with real-life difficulties
- Gaming behaviour may be due to underlying conditions

#### The ‘Achiever’

- Potentially Problematic
- Highly impulsive
- Generally sensation-seeking
- Low self-control
- High self esteem
- Posesses a drive to achieve
- Seeks to progress in the game
- Less interested in role-playing, socialising & escaping
- Has trouble overcoming the immediate gratification provided by the game

#### Hardcore Gamer

- Potentially Problematic
- Combination of The ‘Escaper’ and The ‘Achiever’
- Motivated by achievement, sensation-seeking & role-playing
- May have low self-esteem
- Prone to fully identifying and defining themselves through their gaming even in their real life

However, it should be noted that the reasearch mentioned that it is possible for some people to possess traits of multiple gamer types, and essentially be a “hybrid” type. {% include refpointer.html id=22 %}

### Technology

Use of integrated services and multiplayer environments e.g. Steam, PS Now, Apple Arcade, XBox Live etc and how security has become an issue
