# **Game-Changing Tech: How Current and Emerging Technologies are Shaping the Future of Gaming**

{% include published.html date="2nd March 2023" %}

## What is the Computer Gaming industry?

The computer gaming industry is a multi-billion pound industry that has evolved significantly since the first recognised computer game called _Spacewar!_ in 1962. Today, it consists of three key parts: developers, publishers, and players. {% include refpointer.html id=2 %}

Game developers are the creative minds behind computer games, designing and building games, characters, and storylines. Some of the most influential developers include Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Mojang Studios.

Publishers are responsible for bringing the games to market, providing funding, marketing, and distribution. Revenue in the gaming industry is projected to reach $365.6 billion US dollars in 2023 and has seen significant growth in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. {% include refpointer.html id=3 %}

## What Social and Technological trends have occurred in Computer Gaming?

A genre is how something (such as a computer game) can be categorised. A genre, in computer gaming, describes: {% include refpointer.html id=4 %}

- The style of play
- The types of challenges
- The perspective of the player

Some popular types of genre for computer games are: {% include refpointer.html id=4 %}

### Action games

Action games are characterised by fast-paced gameplay with a focus on mobility, combat, hand-eye coordination, and reaction time. {% include refpointer.html id=5 %}

Any game in which the majority of tasks are physical tests of skill falls under the action genre. Other challenges, such as races or collecting things, can occasionally be included in action games, although they are not core to the genre. {% include refpointer.html id=5 %}

### Adventure games

Adventure games often have few or no action features and focus on puzzle solving within a narrative framework. The definition of "adventure" in the dictionary does not necessarily apply to adventure games. Some are, but many forego risk and thrill in favour of more peaceful, introspective pursuits. {% include refpointer.html id=6 %}

A narrative, puzzles, and exploration are common aspects in adventure games. {% include refpointer.html id=6 %}

### Role-playing games (RPGs)

A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which each player plays the role of a character, usually in a fantasy or science fiction setting, which they may interact with inside the game's fictitious world. {% include refpointer.html id=7 %}

Because of the variety of hybrid genres with RPG features, defining RPGs is extremely difficult. {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

Traditional role-playing video games had five fundamental elements: {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

- The ability to upgrade your character throughout the course of the game by raising their statistics or levels.
- A menu-based combat system featuring a variety of abilities, spells, and attacks.
- An inventory system that allows for the use/storage of items like armour and weapons.
- A main mission that runs across the game as a plot, as well as supplemental (and typically optional) side quests.
- The capacity to interact with parts of the environment or plot via abilities such as lockpicking, disarming traps, communication, et al.
- Character classes exist to determine a character's attributes, talents, abilities, and spells (e.g. wizard, thief, warrior, etc.)

Modern RPGs typically incorporate one or two of these aspects in conjunction with elements from another genre. {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

### Simulation games

Simulation games are typically designed to closely resemble real-world activity. A simulation game seeks to replicate diverse activities from real life in the form of a game for various goals such as training, analysis, prediction, or entertainment. Often, there are no clearly stated goals in the game, and the user is free to manipulate a character or environment. {% include refpointer.html id=9 %}

### Strategy games

Strategy games prioritise thought and preparation above immediate action as the means of success. Although many other types of video games can have strategic components, strategy games as a genre are most typically characterised as those with a major focus on high-level strategy, logistics, and resource management. They are generally often split into two major sub-genres: turn-based and real-time, although there are several strategy sub-genres that include extra components such as tactics, diplomacy, economy, and exploration. {% include refpointer.html id=10 %}

### Sports games

Sports games are recreations of physical sports. Tennis, football, boxing, and motor racing are just a few examples of sports that also exist in video game form. {% include refpointer.html id=11 %}

Some sports games have a focus on actively participating in the sport, while others place an emphasis on strategy and organisation. For humorous effect, some satirise the sport. This genre, like real-world sports, has been popular throughout the history of video games. A number of game series use the names and attributes of real teams and players, and they are updated on a regular basis to match real-world developments. {% include refpointer.html id=11 %}

### Puzzle games

### Idle games

Changes in technology & game design have spawned sub-genres relating to how games are played:  
Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO)  
Real-time Strategy (RTS)  
Sandbox  
Massive Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games (MMORPGs)  
First-Person Shooter (FPS)  
Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)  
Battle Royale  
Action-Adventure

Use of integrated services and multiplayer environments e.g. Steam, PS Now, Apple Arcade, XBox Live etc and how security has become an issue
