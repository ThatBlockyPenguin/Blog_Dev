# **Game-Changing Tech: How Current and Emerging Technologies are Shaping the Future of Gaming**

{% include published.html date="2nd March 2023" %}

## What is the Computer Gaming industry?

The computer gaming industry is a multi-billion pound industry that has evolved significantly since the first recognised computer game called _Spacewar!_ in 1962. Today, it consists of three key parts: developers, publishers, and players. [^2]

Game developers are the creative minds behind computer games, designing and building games, characters, and storylines. Some of the most influential developers include Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Mojang Studios.

Publishers are responsible for bringing the games to market, providing funding, marketing, and distribution. Revenue in the gaming industry is projected to reach $365.6 billion US dollars in 2023 and has seen significant growth in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [^3]

## What Social and Technological trends have occurred in Computer Gaming?

### Genres

A genre is how something (such as a computer game) can be categorised. A genre, in computer gaming, describes: [^4]

- The style of play
- The types of challenges
- The perspective of the player

Some popular types of genre for computer games are: [^4]

#### Action games

Action games are characterised by fast-paced gameplay with a focus on mobility, combat, hand-eye coordination, and reaction time. [^5]

Any game in which the majority of tasks are physical tests of skill falls under the action genre. Other challenges, such as races or collecting things, can occasionally be included in action games, although they are not core to the genre. [^5]

#### Adventure games

Adventure games often have few or no action features and focus on puzzle solving within a narrative framework. The definition of "adventure" in the dictionary does not necessarily apply to adventure games. Some are, but many forego risk and thrill in favour of more peaceful, introspective pursuits. [^6]

A narrative, puzzles, and exploration are common aspects in adventure games. [^6]

#### Role-playing games (RPGs)

A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which each player plays the role of a character, usually in a fantasy or science fiction setting, which they may interact with inside the game's fictitious world. [^7]

Because of the variety of sub-genres with RPG features, defining RPGs is extremely difficult. [^8]

Traditional role-playing video games had five fundamental elements: [^8]

- The ability to upgrade your character throughout the course of the game by raising their statistics or levels.
- A menu-based combat system featuring a variety of abilities, spells, and attacks.
- An inventory system that allows for the use/storage of items like armour and weapons.
- A main mission that runs across the game as a plot, as well as supplemental (and typically optional) side quests.
- The capacity to interact with parts of the environment or plot via abilities such as lockpicking, disarming traps, communication, et al.
- Character classes exist to determine a character's attributes, talents, abilities, and spells (e.g. wizard, thief, warrior, etc.)

Modern RPGs typically incorporate one or two of these aspects in conjunction with elements from another genre. [^8]

#### Simulation games

Simulation games are typically designed to closely resemble real-world activity. A simulation game seeks to replicate diverse activities from real life in the form of a game for various goals such as training, analysis, prediction, or entertainment. Often, there are no clearly stated goals in the game, and the user is free to manipulate a character or environment. [^9]

#### Strategy games

Strategy games prioritise thought and preparation above immediate action as the means of success. Although many other types of video games can have strategic components, strategy games as a genre are most typically characterised as those with a major focus on high-level strategy, logistics, and resource management. They are generally often split into two major sub-genres: turn-based and real-time, although there are several strategy sub-genres that include extra components such as tactics, diplomacy, economy, and exploration. [^10]

#### Sports games

Sports games are recreations of physical sports. Tennis, football, boxing, and motor racing are just a few examples of sports that also exist in video game form. [^11]

Some sports games have a focus on actively participating in the sport, while others place an emphasis on strategy and organisation. For humorous effect, some satirise the sport. This genre, like real-world sports, has been popular throughout the history of video games. A number of game series use the names and attributes of real teams and players, and they are updated on a regular basis to match real-world developments. [^11]

#### Puzzle games

Puzzle games focus on logical and intellectual obstacles, although they frequently include time-pressure or other action components. Although many action or adventure games include puzzles, such as collecting difficult-to-reach things, a true puzzle game emphasises problem solving as the core gameplay mechanic. Games typically contain shapes, colours, or symbols that the player must manipulate directly or indirectly into a specified pattern. [^12]

Puzzle games often show a sequence of similar puzzles that are variations on a same idea. This might entail pattern recognition, logic, or understanding a process. These games often feature a straightforward set of rules in which players manipulate game pieces on a grid, network, or other interaction area. [^12]

#### Idle games

In an idle game, players perform basic activities, such as clicking a button, which earns them in-game currency. The currency may be spent to buy equipment or skills that allow the player to acquire the currency more quickly or automatically without having to do the first activity. [^13]

A recurring topic is providing the player with sources of money represented by structures such as factories or farms. These sources improve the pace of currency gain, however higher tier sources generally have an exponentially greater cost, therefore upgrading between tiers usually takes the same amount of time or even longer. [^13]

This provides an environment with no way to “lose”, low-pressure (as you do not have to play constantly to succeed), and steady progress and feedback, which is ideal for social or mobile play patterns and typically provides high levels of player retention. [^13]

### Sub-Genres

Advances in technology and game design have had a significant influence on gaming, creating sub-genres within (frequently overlapping) genres. Some sub-genres can even be seen as sub-genres of sub-genres! [^4]

#### Massive Multiplayer Online Game (MMO) / Massive Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game (MMORPG)

An MMO is a game in which many people may play together at the same time over the internet. These games are typically played in a social context, which the user may access after installing the game. [^14]

An MMORPG, as the name implies, is a form of MMO which belongs to the [RPG genre](#role-playing-games-rpgs). [^15]

By definition, an MMORPG is both an MMO and an RPG, whereas MMOs can be anything from a Battle Royale game to a real-time strategy game, or anything else - as long as it fits the MMO category. [^15]

#### Real-time Strategy (RTS)

In Real-time strategy games, players construct troops and defeat their opponents by using resources and skill. Real-time strategy games are usually compared to turn-based strategy games, in which each player has time to carefully consider their next move without being concerned about the moves of their opponent, as each player makes their move on their turn. Real-time strategy games however, allow all players to play simultaneously, with players gathering resources, defending their bases, and launching attacks while being aware that their opponent is doing the same. and may attack at any time. [^16]

#### Sandbox

A sandbox game is one in which the player has few constraints, allowing them to freely traverse and modify a virtual world. In contrast to a progression-style game, a sandbox game emphasises exploration and lets the player select tasks. A sandbox game often takes place in a "world" to which the player has total access from beginning to end, rather than separated areas or numbered levels. [^17]

Players may choose whether or not to explore structured components of the game, such as mini-games, quests, and storylines. Oftentimes, the non-sequential nature of sandbox games presents game designers with many narrative challenges. As a result, tasks and side-quests often follow a pattern, with tasks unlocking upon successful completion of other objectives. [^17]

#### First-Person Shooter (FPS)

A first-person shooter game is played from the protagonist's point of view. during gameplay, the character's arms are normally seen at the bottom of the screen, carrying whatever item is equipped. [^18]

Most FPS games have added realism features, such as the rocking of the screen to represent natural human movement, breathing sounds, and footsteps. [^18]

#### Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)

A MOBA is a form of highly competitive video game in which two teams of players compete against each other in a battle arena. Each player has control of a single character, each with their own set of talents and skills, and generally, work together to demolish the opponent team's base while defending their own. [^19]

The gameplay often includes defeating opponent troops and structures to collect in-game currency, which can then be used to enhance abilities and purchase items. Each player's character has a class, such as a tank, a healer, or an archer, and teams normally include a good mix of these roles to form a balanced lineup. As the game progresses, team fights become more intense and players become stronger, leading to an exciting and challenging gaming experience. [^19]

They require players to think on their feet, work together with their team, and make quick decisions, making them an engaging and immersive gaming experience. [^19]

#### Battle Royale

A battle royale game is a type of online multiplayer game that features last-man-standing gameplay with certain aspects of a survival game, such as exploration and scavenging. Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players who start with limited equipment and must eliminate all opponents while avoiding getting trapped outside of a diminishing "safe region." The winner is the last player or team standing. [^20]

#### Action-Adventure

As the name suggests, action-adventure games combine features from both action games and adventure games. They involve physical skills commonly seen in action games, but also include narrative elements such as compelling storylines, multiple characters, dialogue, and an inventory system that are typically found in adventure games. As a result, playing action-adventure games presents the player with both combat and logic-testing challenges. The gameplay in action-adventure games is typically more intense than pure adventure games, and players typically control a single avatar as the protagonist. These games can be categorized into different types such as first-person action-adventure, third-person action-adventure, platform-adventure games, stealth games, and survival games. [^21]

### Types of Gamer

Research has been done to identify the different types of computer gamers that exist. It found that there were 5 main types, categorisable into “potentially problematic” and “non-problematic”. [^22]

#### Recreational Gamer

- Non-problematic
- Has low impulsivity
- Has high self-esteem
- Generally spends less time gaming overall
- Finds gaming more of a hobby and not something they _have_ to do
- Gaming is just an activity that they enjoy

#### Social Gamer

- Non-problematic
- Has low impulsivity
- May have low self-esteem
- Plays for the social experience and role-playing potential
- Doesn't find themselves needing to play out of compulsion
- Likely enjoys creating virtual characters but not as a means to replace their real-life identity

#### The ‘Escaper’

- Potentially Problematic
- Seeks to relieve negative mood states through gaming
- Highly motivated by immersive gameplay for its escapism
- May have poor self-esteem
- Less sensation-seeking
- Highly impulsive traits
- Gaming may be as a means to cope with real-life difficulties
- Gaming behaviour may be due to underlying conditions

#### The ‘Achiever’

- Potentially Problematic
- Highly impulsive
- Generally sensation-seeking
- Low self-control
- High self esteem
- Posesses a drive to achieve
- Seeks to progress in the game
- Less interested in role-playing, socialising & escaping
- Has trouble overcoming the immediate gratification provided by the game
- Probably do not play to achieve an idealised sense of self
- Playing because they want to master the game

#### Hardcore Gamer

- Potentially Problematic
- Combination of The ‘Escaper’ and The ‘Achiever’
- Motivated by achievement, sensation-seeking & role-playing
- May have low self-esteem
- Prone to fully identifying and defining themselves through their gaming even in their real life

However, it should be noted that the reasearch mentioned that it is possible for some people to possess traits of multiple gamer types, and essentially be a “hybrid” type. [^22]

### Technology

#### Integrated Services

Integrated services and multiplayer settings are critical components of today's video gaming experience. These services let gamers to communicate with one another, play together, and access a variety of gaming material. Some of the most popular video game integrated services and multiplayer environments are:

- **Steam:** Steam is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation. It offers a wide range of games, both single-player and multiplayer, and provides features such as in-game chat, cloud saves, and social networking. Steam also includes a marketplace where players can buy and sell in-game items. [^23]
- **PlayStation Plus:** PlayStation Plus is a paid subscription service that provides users with access to premium features. These features include online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and free monthly game downloads. The "Extra" and "Premium" tiers provide access to a wider catalogue of games and additional features such as downloadable games, limited trials of select games, and cloud streaming of games. All tiers of subscription offer the Game Help feature, which provides spoiler-free hints and tips while playing supported games. [^24]
- **Apple Arcade:** Apple Arcade is a game subscription service established by Apple for their own devices. It provides a carefully chosen selection of games for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS devices. Multiplayer games are also available in Apple Arcade, allowing people to play together on the same device or online. It provides continuous, unintrusive experiences by omitting practises associated with popular, largely free-to-play, mobile games, such as in-app purchases and adverts. [^25]
- **Xbox Network:** Xbox Network is an online gaming and content distribution service for Xbox consoles. It offers multiplayer games, downloadable demos, trailers, and full games through Xbox Live Arcade. Users can choose a gamertag, create friends lists, and play with real-life friends or new people online. Xbox Live Gold is a subscription-based service that can be purchased for one month, three months, or one year. It offers two levels of service, with the free level, called Xbox Live Silver, providing access to Xbox Marketplace downloads, app usage, and chat features. However, Xbox Live Gold is required to play most games online. Xbox Network requires an Xbox console and broadband internet. [^26]

In addition to these, many video games also offer their own integrated multiplayer environments. These environments may range from relatively simple such as Minecraft's text-chat-only in-game chat, to more complex features, like full on voice chat in Team Fortress 2. Games such as these often have large playerbases who connect with each other and play together regularly, often forming into smaller communities.

Overall, integrated services and multiplayer environments are essential components of the modern video gaming experience. They allow players to connect with each other and access a wide range of gaming content, creating a rich and vibrant gaming culture.

#### Security Issues

With the inclusion of such services, game developers have had to put systems in place that ensure a fair and welcoming space for everyone. This may be by creating filters that prevent certain words from appearing in messages, by implementing a banning feature that allows repeat offenders to be removed from the platform, and so on.

There are also new security risks being exposed by computer games. A report by SecurityHQ states that _"there has been a monumental surge in targeted cyber-attacks against the gaming sector, with a 167% increase in web application attacks in 2021 alone"_. Of course, as the industry grows, the motivation for a successful attack grows with it. [^27]

A recent example is _Minecraft_ and the Log4Shell vulnerability. Log4Shell was discovered by Chen Zhaojun of the Alibaba Cloud Security Team, and is the name given to a zero-day vulnerability in Log4j, a popular logging framework for the Java programming language. _Minecraft: Java Edition_ is developed in the Java programming language, and uses Log4j, and as such, was affected by this vulnerability. [^28] [^29]

The official article on the Minecraft Help website stated that “This exploit affects many services - including \_Minecraft: Java Edition\_”. Their response to the situation was swift and well-handled, providing a fix for all affected versions of the game. [^29]

Other issues that game developers have to worry about are social exploitation, such as phishing, in their in-game chats. Similarly, American game publisher 2K recently had their helpdesk compromised, and had malicious content sent out to their customers. [^27]

### Game Production

There are various ways that game development can be funded, whether by mainstream developers and publishers, such as Valve, Blizzard, or Rockstar, by independent (indie) developers, via crowdfunding such as Kickstarter, by making the game paid, or by making it free to play, with in-app-purchases (IAPs). [^30]

### Devices Used & Hardware

Throughout the history of gaming, the industry has seen many changes and advancements. From the early days of computer games to the modern era of virtual reality and eSports, gaming has evolved and expanded in countless ways.

The early days of gaming in the 1960s and 1970s saw the development of games played on mainframe computers using teletype machines or early terminals. These games, such as _Spacewar!_ and _Hunt the Wumpus_, were the first of their kind and set the stage for the industry to come.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the first home gaming consoles were introduced, including the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision. These consoles allowed players to connect to their TV and play simple games like _Pong_, _Space Invaders_, and _Pac-Man_ from the comfort of their own homes.

The 1980s saw the rise of personal computers, which quickly became a popular gaming platform. Popular games from this era include titles like _Ultima_, _Zork_, and _King's Quest_.

The 1990s brought about the rise of gaming consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Sony PlayStation, which saw the introduction of iconic franchises like _Super Mario Bros._, _Sonic the Hedgehog_, and _Final Fantasy_. This era also saw the continuation of PC gaming alongside consoles.

The early 2000s saw the rise of online gaming and multiplayer games, with popular titles like _Club Penguin_, _World of Warcraft_, and _Counter-Strike_. Consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation 2 also began to support online play.

The 2010s marked the explosion of mobile gaming thanks to the widespread adoption of smartphones and tablets. Games like _Angry Birds_, _Candy Crush_, and _Pokémon Go_ became massively popular, making gaming more accessible to a wider audience.

Today, virtual reality gaming and esports are becoming more and more popular. VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and Valve Index allow players to fully immerse themselves in virtual worlds, while eports tournaments and leagues draw millions of viewers worldwide. Gaming continues to evolve and expand, and it will be exciting to see what the future holds for this industry.

#### Hardware

The first computer games were hard-coded into a system, and each console played one game. After a few years - around the mid 70s, the idea of a swappable “game cartridge” started to gain popularity. [^31] [^32]

In the 1980s, the video game market crashed, due to the oversaturation of the market with low-quality games - which lasted a few years. [^32]

A few years later, the gaming market went mobile, with the introduction of handheld devices such as the Game Boy. [^32] These consoles allowed for interchangeable cartridges to load different games, and for portability so people could play games on the go! [^32] By 1988 the crash was a mere memory, and global games revenues returned to over $20 billion per year! It was during this time that franchises such as Mario, Zelda, and Street Fighter began to emerge. [^32]

In 1994, the personal computer was becoming increasingly common in US households, with an estimated 24 million homes (27% of households) owning one. And while PCs were initially viewed as tools for work and productivity, they quickly became popular for their gaming capabilities. In fact, nearly half of all PC owners (48%) played games on their computer. [^32]

One reason for the popularity of the PC was its versatility. In addition to gaming, PCs offered other utilities like web browsing and document processing, and as technology continued to advance, PCs began to incorporate new features like CD-ROM drives (that were found in 35% of US households) and sound cards (in 20% of US households). [^32]

The launch of the first popular 3D game, Doom, in 1993 further solidified the PC's position as a premier gaming platform. Doom was a groundbreaking first-person shooter that pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the gaming world. It went on to influence not only subsequent shooter games but video gaming as a whole. And it was so successful that it was eventually made available on nearly every video gaming system. [^32]

One of the key features of Doom was its multiplayer mode, which allowed players to compete against one another online. This was a major breakthrough at the time and helped to establish the first-person shooter genre as we know it today. [^32]

In fact, the Doom Engine (the game engine created to power Doom) was used to base the Quake Engine on (the game engine created to power Quake). Games developer and publisher Valve then created the GoldSrc engine from this, which over time evolved into the Source engine, then into the Source 2 Engine. [^33] [^34] [^35] [^36] [^37]

The GoldSrc, Source, and Source 2 engines were used to create highly popular games such as Half-Life, Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, Portal, Left 4 Dead, The Stanley Parable (originally as a Half-Life mod), and Dota! [^38] All these games (and more) effectively exist because of Doom's underlying technology!

The popularity of PC gaming led to the formation of a dedicated community of gamers. And while there was some overlap with console gamers, the two communities generally remained distinct. Even today, the debate over which platform is better rages on. [^32]

## Current Technologies in Gaming

There are various technologies available in the gaming industry, from hardware - the physical parts of a device, software - the programs that run on a device, to game engines - the platforms upon which games can be built. It's important to keep up-to-date with all the latest options as outdated hardware and software may be incompatible with newer games, and they may run slower or even not run at all!

### Hardware Options

#### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the main component of a computer system that handles the majority of the processing work. It is frequently referred to as the "brains" of a computer, as it interprets and executes that instructions that make up software, and coordinates the work of other components.

In a gaming system, the CPU is crucial in determining a system's overall performance. It is in charge of processes such as game logic, physics computations, and artificial intelligence algorithms. The more powerful and quicker the CPU, the better the system will be able to manage these duties and give a smooth and responsive gaming experience. If the CPU is not up to the task, you may experience lag or low frames-per-second (FPS) when playing.

The CPU is also responsible for managing the data flow between the graphics card and other components of the system. This means that a powerful CPU is essential for avoiding bottlenecks and ensuring that the graphics card is able to operate at its full potential. In short, the CPU is a crucial component of a gaming system and plays a critical role in ensuring that the system can handle the demands of modern games.

As of writing (March 2023), the highest ranking CPUs as according to Tom's Hardware are (in no particular order): [^39]

As you can see, AMD and Intel have cornered the market for CPUs, and, in fact, are pretty much the only two companies in the business - especially for consumer devices.

#### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

{% include img.html url="https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/gpu-power-ladder-all-graphics-cards-tested-1569663337391.jpg/BROK/resize/1380%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/gpu-power-ladder-all-graphics-cards-tested-1569663337391.jpg" src="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2019-09-27-gpu-power-ladder-all-graphics-cards-tested" credit="EuroGamer" desc="Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti" %}

The GPU is a specialised processor that is designed to handle the complex mathematical calculations required for rendering high-quality graphics, to the screen.

In gaming, the GPU plays a crucial role by generating pixels that are displayed on the screen. The CPU runs the game logic and sends any visual data to the GPU, which then takes care of converting this raw data into pixels that appear on screen.

The more powerful the GPU, the more complex and detailed the graphics can be. This can result in smoother gameplay, higher frame rates, and more realistic visuals. Gamers often invest in high-end GPUs to get the best gaming experience possible.

As of writing, according to TechRadar, some of the best GPUs are (in no particula): [^46]

As you can see - AMD and Nvidia are the two main competitors in the GPU field.

#### Memory (RAM)

RAM (Random Access Memory, or just Memory) is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data and instructions that are actively being used by the computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit). RAM is a crucial component of a computer's architecture and is responsible for providing fast access to data and instructions that are currently in use, as opposed to slower storage devices like hard drives or SSDs.

In gaming, RAM plays an important role in ensuring smooth gameplay by allowing the computer to store and access large amounts of game data quickly. When you launch a game, the game's data is loaded into RAM, from storage, so that it can be accessed quickly by the CPU when needed. This includes things like the game's graphics, sound effects, music, and other game assets.

Having enough RAM is important for gaming, as it allows the computer to run the game smoothly without stuttering or freezing. This is because is takes noticably longer to load data from storage instead of memory. The amount of RAM required for gaming depends on the specific game you are playing, as well as the overall configuration of your computer. Generally speaking, most modern games require at least 8GB of RAM, although some games may require more. If you have an insufficient amount of memory, your computer may struggle to keep up with the demands of the game, resulting in a suboptimal gaming experience.

As according to IGN, some of the best memory is: [^47]

#### Storage

Storage is like memory, as in, it provides a location for data to be kept, except that storage provides a long-term data repository, whereas RAM is short-term. The role of storage in gaming is critical, as it enables players to save game progress, store game files, and install game updates. Without storage, there wouldn't even be an Operating System (i.e. Windows, macOS, etc) for the game to run on.

Obviously, the ability to store game save data is crucial in gameing. It allows players to pick up where they left off in a game, rather than starting from scratch each time they restart the game. Storage is also used to store game installations and updates, which can be downloaded and installed from online stores. As games become more complex and detailed, the size of these files can be quite large, requiring larger and faster storage devices to ensure smooth gameplay and fast loading times.

Many gaming platforms also allow players to back up their save files to cloud-based storage, which ensures that progress is not lost in the event of a hardware failure or other issue. In addition, some gaming platforms offer automatic cloud backups, which enable players to seamlessly switch between devices and continue playing their game without interruption.

There are two main types of storage - Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs). HDDs have a spinning metal disc inside which is used to encode data magnetically. SSDs have no moving parts, and are purely electronical. They work like flash storage - the type in USB sticks. Because of the moving parts, HDDs are more fragile than SSDs, and are also slower to read and write data. SSDs are faster, but they generally have a lower storage capacity than HDDs (although they are slowly catching up!). Due to the higher speed, SSDs are generally recommended for gaming, but some people have a HDD for their main storage and a separate SSD solely for their games & game data, so they can get the most out of the storage capacity.

PCGamer has a list of the best SSDs for gaming, some of which are below, in no particular order (specifications from PCPartPicker): [^48]

#### Output

##### Display

There are several types of video output available, including HDMI, DisplayPort, and VGA. Each has its own unique set of pros and cons that should be considered when deciding which type of output to use.

HDMI is the most commonly used output for gaming and offers high-quality video and audio transmission. It is easy to use and supports high resolutions and refresh rates. However, it has limited bandwidth compared to other types of output, which can affect performance at higher resolutions and refresh rates.

DisplayPort is another popular output for gaming that offers higher bandwidth than HDMI, making it better suited for high-resolution gaming. It also supports advanced features like G-Sync and FreeSync, which can provide a smoother gaming experience. It can also transmit audio, although it is not a required specification for manufacturers. However, it is less common than HDMI, and not all gaming monitors and graphics cards support it.

VGA is an older output that is still used in some older setups, although very rare in modern gaming. It offers lower quality than HDMI and DisplayPort and is limited in terms of resolution and refresh rates. However, it can still be useful for older systems that do not support newer types of output. It does not carry an audio signal.

In summary, HDMI is the best choice for most gaming setups due to its high-quality video and audio transmission and wide compatibility. DisplayPort is a good alternative for high-resolution gaming and advanced features, while VGA is suitable only for older systems or as a backup option.

##### Audio

In addition to video output options, there are several types of audio output options available for gaming setups. The most common audio output options for gaming include the 3.5mm audio jack, USB, and optical audio.

The 3.5mm audio jack is the most widely used audio output option for gaming, and it is found on most headsets and speakers. It is easy to use - simply plug and play - and most gaming setups have a 3.5mm jack built-in. However, it is limited in terms of audio quality and does not support advanced features like true surround sound.

USB audio output is another popular option that offers better audio quality than the 3.5mm jack. It also supports advanced features like surround sound, however, not all gaming headsets and speakers support USB audio, and it can be more expensive than a standard 3.5mm headset. USB audio also eliminates any interference from the motherboard or other components in the gaming setup. However, not all gaming headsets and speakers support USB audio, and it can be more expensive than a standard 3.5mm headset.

Optical audio is another option that provides high-quality audio and supports advanced features like surround sound. However, it is much less common than the 3.5mm jack and USB and requires a dedicated optical audio port on the gaming setup. It uses fiber optic cables to transmit audio data, which eliminates any interference or noise from other components in the gaming setup. Because of this, the cables should not be bent much, which may not be ideal for a gaming setup.

In summary, the choice of audio output option for gaming depends on the specific needs of the user. The 3.5mm jack is the most commonly used option and is suitable for most casual gamers. USB audio provides better audio quality and advanced features, while optical audio offers high-quality audio and surround sound, but requires a dedicated port and may be more expensive.

It should also be noted that some video output options also allow for audio transmission, such as HDMI or DisplayPort.

##### Other

In addition to video and audio output, modern gaming systems also support various other output options, such as vibrations and haptic feedback, that enhance the gaming experience. When choosing gaming accessories, it's important to consider which types of feedback they support and how they can enhance your gaming experience.

###### Vibrations

Vibrations are a common form of feedback used in mobile phones, gaming controllers, and accessories. They provide tactile feedback to players, such as the feeling of recoil when firing a gun or the rumble of a car engine. Vibrations are a simple but effective way to add immersion to games, and most gaming controllers support vibration feedback. It does require a device that supports vibrations however (e.g. a mouse and keyboard don't support vibration).

###### Haptic feedback

Haptic feedback is a more advanced form of feedback that uses more sophisticated technology to simulate a range of tactile sensations, such as pressure, texture, and temperature. Haptic feedback is becoming more common in modern gaming systems, and it is used to provide a more realistic and immersive gaming experience. Some controllers and accessories, such as the PlayStation DualSense controller, use haptic feedback to provide advanced sensations like adaptive triggers, which can simulate the feeling of tension in a bowstring or the resistance of a trigger.

#### Input

Input devices are essential in gaming since they allow players to interact with the game. Below are the most prevalent gaming input devices, along with their benefits and drawbacks:

1. Keyboard and Mouse:

#### Connections

When it comes to multiplayer gaming, the sort of connection you use can have a huge influence on your gaming experience. There are numerous sorts of connections available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

##### Internet 

An Internet connection is the most common type of connection used for multiplayer gaming. It allows players to connect to game servers over the Internet and play with other players around the world. Internet connections are usually required for games with online multiplayer modes or MMO games. However, lag and connectivity issues may occur due to distance and internet traffic, and a stable and fast internet connection is required, which may not be available in all areas.

##### Local Network

A local network connection allows players to connect to other devices on the same network, such as other players in the same household or LAN party. Local network connections are ideal for local multiplayer games. They offer low latency and high-speed connection for most devices connected to the same network. However, they are limited to players on the same network.

##### Mobile Network

A mobile network connection allows players to connect to the Internet through their cellular data, on devices such as smartphones or tablets. Mobile network connections are best suited for gaming on-the-go. They offer mobility and a high-speed and stable connection in most urban areas. However, they are limited to data plans, which can be expensive or have limited data usage, and may not be suitable for gaming requiring precise timing or fast reactions. Also, not all areas have signal, and some materials are especially good at blocking data frequencies - you could be playing great one moment, then you turn a corner and lose connection.

##### Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct

Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct connections allow players to connect to other devices directly without the need for an internet connection. These connections are suitable for connecting two devices in close proximity. They offer low latency and high-speed connection for devices connected through the same connection, and no need for an internet connection or mobile data plan. However, they are limited to players in close proximity and may require devices to be paired manually, which can be time-consuming and frustrating. These methods, however, are fairly rare in gaming scenarios.

### Software Options

#### Operating System (OS)

- Windows:
  
  Windows is by far the most widely used operating system for gaming, [^52] and with good reason - it has many gaming-focussed features. These are:

  - DirectX 12, the latest version of Microsoft's DirectX API, which is what games use to communicate with your computer. DirectX 12 introduces several new capabilities and benefits, including the ability for graphics cards to utilise more than one CPU core at the same time. This means, basically, that Windows optimises the system resources available to games in order to make them operate more efficiently. This may come in especially helpful in scenarios where a slight delay between processing and rendering on-screen might mean the difference between a battle won or lost. [^53] I'll go more in-depth on DirectX [later](#graphics).

  - The Game Bar, which enables you to record game clips or take screenshots from a game you are playing. All you have to do is hit Windows + G, and the Game Bar pops up from which you can easily post your clip on to YouTube or other social networks. The Game Bar also allows you to monitor your PC's performance, change your volume settings, and chat with your friends on Xbox social. [^53]

  - Xbox controller support, allowing PC gamers to experience the ergonomic controls previously reserved for console gamers. Windows supports Xbox Wireless, USB, and Bluetooth connections. [^53] [^54]

- Mac OS:
  
  Mac OS is not as popular as Windows for gaming, probably due to the library of games available for the Mac being significantly smaller than that on Windows. However, with the update to macOS Ventura, the gaming scene may be changing for the Mac. [^55]

  - Apple's introduction of Metal 3 is expected to be one of the most significant developments. Metal, Apple's graphics engine, allows programmers to fully utilise a Mac's GPU. The third-generation release should see substantial advancements in video game visuals.

  - Game Center, the gaming social hub for Apple devices, has received an update for the Mac. A new visible activity feed has been added, allowing you to keep track of what your friends are playing and what accomplishments they have unlocked. In addition to this, Game Center will keep you up-to-date with the latest happenings in Apple Arcade, display leaderboards for your friends, and showcase any achievements you have unlocked.

- Linux:
  
  While Linux has grown in popularity among gamers, it is still regarded as a niche platform due to its rather steep learning curve and limited game support when compared to Windows.
  
  - Emulation software such as Wine and Proton can allow Linux users to play many Windows games on their devices.

  - Microsoft has made attempts in recent years to introduce its previously mentioned DirectX API to Linux. This innovation has the potential to increase game performance on Linux while also encouraging more game creators to support the platform.

  - Valve has also created SteamOS, a Linux-based game operating system, and the Steam Deck, a portable gaming device that runs a modified version of SteamOS. These advances have boosted interest in Linux as a viable gaming platform, which may lead to further game support in the future.

  - Linux is known for its excellent performance, which can lead to smoother gameplay and faster load times.

  - Many popular game engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine, have added Linux support, making it easier for developers to create games that run on the platform.

  - Linux is highly customizable, allowing gamers to tweak and optimize their systems for the best possible gaming experience.

  - Linux is free and open-source, which means that gamers don't have to pay for expensive operating systems or software licenses.

#### Programming Language

Programming languages are instruction sets designed for humans to write and computers to execute. They are used to create software applications, websites, and other computer programs, including games. Code written in these languages make up every part of a game that isn't a resource (something like a texture or sound file). In this section, we will explore some of the most commonly used programming languages in the gaming industry, including their pros and cons.

- C++ [^56]

  Popular games made with Java:

  - Minecraft: Java Edition
  - Runescape
  - Mission Impossible III

Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of language depends on the specific requirements of the game being developed. C++ is a popular choice for high-performance games, while Java is well-suited for mobile game development and cross-platform support. HTML5/JavaScript is a good choice for browser-based games. Ultimately, the choice of programming language should be based on the requirements of the game and the expertise of the development team.

#### Drivers

Drivers are pieces of software that allow other pieces of software to communicate with specific hardware - either internal components or external devices.

Let's take the example of a game controller. In order for the game to receive input from the controller, a device driver is needed to enable communication between the controller and the game.

  The device driver for a game controller typically communicates with the controller's hardware, translating the signals sent by the buttons and joysticks into a format that the game can understand. This allows the game to recognize which buttons are being pressed and how the joysticks are being moved, and to respond accordingly.

Without a device driver, the game would not be able to communicate with the game controller, and the player would not be able to use the controller to play the game.

Device drivers for game controllers are often included with the operating system or are installed automatically when the controller is connected to the computer. However, in some cases, a specific device driver may need to be downloaded and installed manually in order for the controller to work properly with a particular game or operating system.

You can also get drivers for things like mice, keyboards, GPUs, and speakers/sound cards.

#### Graphics

A "library", in programming terms, is a collection of code that has been written by another person or group of people, and can be imported for use within other programs. Graphics libraries are an example of these.

Graphics libraries play a critical role in modern gaming, enabling game developers to create immersive and visually stunning games. Graphics libraries provide a standardised way for game developers to access the graphics hardware of input/output devices such as graphics cards, which allows them to create advanced graphics and animations.

Two of the most popular graphics libraries used in gaming are DirectX and OpenGL. DirectX is a set of APIs developed by Microsoft that provides access to the hardware features of input/output devices, such as graphics cards and sound cards. DirectX includes audio, graphics, and input APIs, which allow game developers to create games that work well on a variety of hardware configurations. DirectX is included in Windows, making it one of the most popular graphics libraries around. [^58]

OpenGL, short for "Open Graphics Library", is an open-source solution that provides access to the graphics hardware of input/output devices. It is designed to be platform-independent, which means that games developed using OpenGL can run on a wide range of hardware and operating systems. OpenGL is particularly popular on Linux and macOS platforms.  [^59]

Both DirectX and OpenGL provide game developers with a set of tools and functions that can be used to create advanced graphics and animations. For example, they include functions for creating 2D and 3D graphics, handling textures, and managing lighting and shadows. These tools and functions allow game developers to create visually stunning environments, characters, and objects that help bring the game world to life. [^58] [^59]

In addition to DirectX and OpenGL, game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity also include a range of graphics libraries that game developers can use to create advanced graphics and animations. These engines often include both DirectX and OpenGL, as well as other graphics libraries like Vulkan and Metal, which provide additional functionality and support for different hardware configurations.

So, graphics libraries provide game developers with a standardised way to access the graphics hardware of input/output devices and a set of tools and functions for creating advanced graphics and animations. By using these graphics libraries, game developers can create games that work well on a variety of hardware configurations and offer players an immersive and engaging gaming experience.

#### Audio

When it comes to gaming, audio can be just as important as graphics. Whether you're playing a first-person shooter or a role-playing game, the right audio can enhance your experience and make you feel more immersed in the game world.

##### Music

Music is one of the most important audio options in gaming. It can set the mood for a game and help create a sense of atmosphere. Some games have original soundtracks that are specifically designed to complement the gameplay, while others licence existing music.

In-game music can also be used to give players important cues or signals. For example, a change in music might indicate that the player is approaching a boss battle or that they've completed a level. Players can also choose to play their own music in the background while gaming, or have none entirely (by muting the game's music).

##### Ambiance

Ambient sound effects are another important audio option in gaming. They can add a sense of realism to the game world and make players feel like they're really there. Ambient sound effects can include things like footsteps, weather effects, and background chatter.

In some games, ambient sound effects can also be used to give players important clues or hints. For example, a change in ambient sound might indicate that the player is near a hidden item or that an enemy is approaching.

##### File Format

Finally, it's important to consider the file format of your gaming audio. Different file formats can have different levels of quality and compression, which can affect the overall audio experience. Some common audio file formats for gaming include MP3, OGG, WAV, and FLAC.

MP3 files are the most widely used audio format and are generally considered to be of decent quality. However, there may be potential licensing issues with using MP3 files in games, as it is a patented format. OGG files, on the other hand, are a free and open source alternative to MP3 that offer similar quality and compression. WAV files are uncompressed, which means they offer the highest quality audio, but they can also take up a lot of storage space. FLAC files offer a good balance between quality and storage space, making them a popular choice for gaming.

### Game Engines

A game engine is a type of software development environment that is specifically designed for creating video games. A game engine may include 1 2D or 3D graphics rendering engine, a physics engine that simulates real-world physics, artificial intelligence that automatically responds to the player's actions, a sound engine, an animation engine, and a bunch of other features. [^60]

#### Rendering Engines

Rendering engines are responsible for generating graphics and rendering them on the screen. They are designed to take raw models, textures, and lighting information and transform them into a 2D image that can be displayed on a screen. Game engines use advanced rendering techniques such as dynamic lighting, reflections, and shadows to create realistic and immersive environments that can be explored by players.

#### Physics Engines

Physics engines are used to simulate the physical behaviour of objects in a game world. They are responsible for calculating and applying the forces that affect objects, such as gravity, friction, and collisions. This allows developers to create realistic simulations of real-world phenomena, such as the movement of water or the behaviour of a car on a bumpy road.

#### Collision Detection

Collision detection is a critical component of game development, as it determines when two objects collide and what happens when they do. Game engines use complex algorithms to detect collisions between objects and calculate their resulting behaviour, such as bouncing off each other or exploding. This allows developers to create realistic and engaging gameplay mechanics that are based on physical interactions between objects.

#### Scripting

Scripting is a powerful tool used by game developers to control the behaviour of objects in a game world. Game engines allow developers to create custom scripts using languages such as C# or GDScript, which can be used to control the movement, behaviour, and interactions of objects in the game world. This allows developers to create complex gameplay mechanics and AI systems that can react to player input and provide a challenging and engaging experience.

#### Animation

Animation is another important aspect of game development, which gives people, objects, and the environment a realistic feel. Advanced animation algorithms used by game engines enable developers to generate intricate movements for characters and objects, including walking, sprinting, and leaping. Depending on how the game is designed, these animations may be set to happen automatically or in response to user interaction.

The process of creating a video game from scratch takes time and is difficult. It involves a lot of trial and error, strong programming abilities, and specific game development expertise. As many of the underlying systems shared by games of various types have already been developed by others (such as graphics rendering, physics simulation, and input processing), leveraging them may help creators save a lot of time and money. Game engines are a simple way of doing this.

### New Technology in Game Development

There are various modern technologies that are emerging in the gaming scene, and they have the potential to revolutionise the way that people play video games.

#### Artificial Intelligence

The recent and massive strides forward in AI, with new models like ChatGPT, could mean the beginning of a whole new era for gaming. [^61]

Typically, in games, what is referred to as "AI" is actually nothing more than a highly complex algorithm. If we take the example of a Minecraft sheep and [look at its code](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:reading_mc_code){: target="_blank" }, we can see that it has eight main "AI goals", each with a higher priority than the last. These are:

- SwimGoal
- EscapeDangerGoal
- AnimalMateGoal
- TemptGoal
- FollowParentGoal
- EatGrassGoal
- WanderAroundFarGoal
- LookAtEntityGoal (the code specifies looking at players)
- LookAroundGoal

The functions of each of these goals are quite clear - the sheep is most likely to just look around, but if a player is nearby, it may look at them. It may also wander around and eat grass, follow its parent (if it is a baby), get tempted by players holding wheat, mate with other sheep, run away if hurt, or swim. There is no real AI going on here. This could, however, be about to change.

The writer of [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/02/16/chatgpt-is-coming-to-video-games-god-help-us-all/) [^61] asks: _"What if instead of a list of pre-programmed responses and limited interactions, you could chat with NPCs in a video game and have an actual, unpredictable conversation?"_ It's a very interesting question. Image playing a game where you could interact with characters in a way unheard of before, and effectively write your own story! [^61]

There are concerns however, about whether or not AIs _should_ be allowed an unrestricted voice in games, as there have been many occasions where AI has been tricked into saying things it was never intended to. [^61]

#### Virtual Reality

Virtual reality is a computer-generated environment that allows people to interact with a simulated three-dimensional world, typically with the use of special equipment such as helmets or goggles. The more immersive the VR experience, the easier it is for someone to suspend their disbelief and accept the virtual environment as "real". VR is classified into three types based on this: non-immersive, semi-immersive, and fully immersive. Although virtual reality has grown in popularity in the gaming industry, it also has applications in education, training, healthcare, retail, real estate, and entertainment. [^62]

One of the most significant benefits of virtual reality is its ability to reproduce circumstances that are difficult, expensive, or dangerous to do so in real life. VR may be used to train people in high-risk or specialised positions, such as firefighters, police officers, or surgeons. It can provide students with immersive interactions in historical or scientific situations that might otherwise be inaccessible to them. It also has promise in the treatment of mental health conditions such as PTSD and anxiety, as well as in providing doctors with novel ways to communicate diagnostic or treatment options. [^62]

Unfortunately, as well as these benefits, VR has numerous potential drawbacks. One of the major issues is that people may become motion sick or uncomfortable while in the virtual environment. Additionally, there is a risk of addiction to VR experiences, which might lead to negative effects such as social isolation or neglect of real-life responsibilities. There are also ethical concerns regarding using virtual reality in violent or harmful environments, since it may desensitise users to real-life violence or encourage unethical behaviour. [^62]

#### Augmented Reality

{% include large-sideimg.html url="https://media.wired.com/photos/5dc9b5efdea30b00096c6cd0/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Cul-minecraft-MCE_MAG_Cover_01.jpg" src="https://www.wired.com/story/minecraft-earth-america-launch/" credit="WIRED" desc="Minecraft Earth, an AR game" %}

Augmented reality (AR) gets its name from the fact that it augments the real world with a computer-generated visual overlay to improve the user's experience. Augmented reality is gaining popularity in computing for both business and gaming. In contrast to virtual reality, augmented reality adds digital renderings to the present environment, instead of creating a whole new scene from scratch. [^63]

Wearable technology has long been seen as a possible game changer for augmented reality. While cameras in tablets and smartphones only provide a limited perspective of the user's surroundings, smart eyewear, if it were to become mainstream, has the potential to more comprehensively merge the real and digital worlds, providing a massive immersion boost for AR games. [^63]

AR technology enables the display a whole virtual world on top of the user's existing real-world surroundings. The popular game Pokémon Go is an example of this, since it allows users to search for animated characters in their neighbourhoods. American National Football League broadcasters use augmented reality technology to analyse plays in more detail. [^63]

Despite its benefits, like VR, AR has a number of disadvantages. One is that some users may find it disorientating, especially if the virtual and real worlds are not properly aligned, or if there is noticeable lag between the movement of the camera and the digital rendering. [^63]

#### Cloud gaming

Cloud gaming is a type of service which allows players to run games on a server in the cloud and have your inputs streamed to it and the outputs streamed back to you. Some examples of this are Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce and the now defunct Google Stadia, as well as the previously discussed PlayStation Plus.

Some of the reasons why people may want to use Cloud Gaming are:

- Cloud gaming allows users to access games from almost any device with an internet connection, making it more accessible to those who do not have access to high-end gaming equipment.
- Cloud gaming allows for greater scalability - game servers can be easily scaled up or down to meet varying numbers of players.
- Cloud Gaming means that players don't need to invest in expensive gaming hardware to play high-quality games, so it may be a less expensive option for some, especially since many Cloud Gaming companies feature a free tier.
- Cloud gaming may open new opportunities for games, such as game saves that persist across devices and cross-platform multiplayer.

One disadvantage is that players must have a reliable and fast connection to the Internet, which may be a sticking point for some players, particularly those in rural areas. Gamers with slow or unstable internet connections may experience high input lag or poor graphics.

Some cloud gaming services may need a paid membership for clients who already pay for games and other forms of entertainment, such as GeForce Now. Although it does offer a free tier, GeForce Now connects to platforms like Steam or Epic Games, and allows players to play games they have purchased through these platforms, whilst also offering both a free and paid subscription, which may mean that an extra cost is incurred just to play games you already own.

Developers may also have to design specific parts of the game to be optimised for streaming services - such as support for a wide variety of input and output systems that people may be using (as many streaming services can be accessed from any device using a web browser), or highly efficient input systems to reduce lag.

### The Impact of Emerging Technologies on Games Development

Over the years, gaming technology has evolved greatly, we now have graphics cards with ray tracing, realistic 3D rendering, and powerful gaming consoles that put the previous generation of console to shame with their high specs, but how did we get here, and what sort of effect has this progression had on gaming?

<div class="multimedia" markdown="1">
<div class="text" markdown="1">
#### Graphics

One of the most obvious examples of how games have evolved over the years is in graphics. Games are now able to render incredibly realistic environments and characters, thanks to advances in GPUs and other rendering technology, such as DirectX, Vulkan, and OpenGL. [^64]

A great example of innovators in the graphics area is Nvidia, bringing ray tracing to the mainstream with their dedicated RT Cores, specifically designed for ray tracing. On the right are a few images comparing the same screenshots of Valve's Portal, one without ray tracing and one with. Below is an image showing the same for Minecraft. The difference is incredible!
