## What is the Computer Gaming industry?

The computer gaming industry is a multi-billion pound industry that has evolved significantly since the first recognised computer game called _Spacewar!_ in 1962. Today, it consists of three key parts: developers, publishers, and players. {% include refpointer.html id=2 %}

Game developers are the creative minds behind computer games, designing and building games, characters, and storylines. Some of the most influential developers include Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Mojang Studios.

Publishers are responsible for bringing the games to market, providing funding, marketing, and distribution. Revenue in the gaming industry is projected to reach $365.6 billion US dollars in 2023 and has seen significant growth in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. {% include refpointer.html id=3 %}
