# **Game-Changing Tech: How Current and Emerging Technologies are Shaping the Future of Gaming**

{% include published.html date="2nd March 2023" %}

## What is the Computer Gaming industry?

The computer gaming industry is a multi-billion pound industry that has evolved significantly since the first recognised computer game called _Spacewar!_ in 1962. Today, it consists of three key parts: developers, publishers, and players. {% include refpointer.html id=2 %}

Game developers are the creative minds behind computer games, designing and building games, characters, and storylines. Some of the most influential developers include Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Mojang Studios.

Publishers are responsible for bringing the games to market, providing funding, marketing, and distribution. Revenue in the gaming industry is projected to reach $365.6 billion US dollars in 2023 and has seen significant growth in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. {% include refpointer.html id=3 %}

## What Social and Technological trends have occurred in Computer Gaming?

### Genres

A genre is how something (such as a computer game) can be categorised. A genre, in computer gaming, describes: {% include refpointer.html id=4 %}

- The style of play
- The types of challenges
- The perspective of the player

Some popular types of genre for computer games are: {% include refpointer.html id=4 %}

#### Action games

Action games are characterised by fast-paced gameplay with a focus on mobility, combat, hand-eye coordination, and reaction time. {% include refpointer.html id=5 %}

Any game in which the majority of tasks are physical tests of skill falls under the action genre. Other challenges, such as races or collecting things, can occasionally be included in action games, although they are not core to the genre. {% include refpointer.html id=5 %}

#### Adventure games

Adventure games often have few or no action features and focus on puzzle solving within a narrative framework. The definition of "adventure" in the dictionary does not necessarily apply to adventure games. Some are, but many forego risk and thrill in favour of more peaceful, introspective pursuits. {% include refpointer.html id=6 %}

A narrative, puzzles, and exploration are common aspects in adventure games. {% include refpointer.html id=6 %}

#### Role-playing games (RPGs)

A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which each player plays the role of a character, usually in a fantasy or science fiction setting, which they may interact with inside the game's fictitious world. {% include refpointer.html id=7 %}

Because of the variety of sub-genres with RPG features, defining RPGs is extremely difficult. {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

Traditional role-playing video games had five fundamental elements: {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

- The ability to upgrade your character throughout the course of the game by raising their statistics or levels.
- A menu-based combat system featuring a variety of abilities, spells, and attacks.
- An inventory system that allows for the use/storage of items like armour and weapons.
- A main mission that runs across the game as a plot, as well as supplemental (and typically optional) side quests.
- The capacity to interact with parts of the environment or plot via abilities such as lockpicking, disarming traps, communication, et al.
- Character classes exist to determine a character's attributes, talents, abilities, and spells (e.g. wizard, thief, warrior, etc.)

Modern RPGs typically incorporate one or two of these aspects in conjunction with elements from another genre. {% include refpointer.html id=8 %}

#### Simulation games

Simulation games are typically designed to closely resemble real-world activity. A simulation game seeks to replicate diverse activities from real life in the form of a game for various goals such as training, analysis, prediction, or entertainment. Often, there are no clearly stated goals in the game, and the user is free to manipulate a character or environment. {% include refpointer.html id=9 %}

#### Strategy games

Strategy games prioritise thought and preparation above immediate action as the means of success. Although many other types of video games can have strategic components, strategy games as a genre are most typically characterised as those with a major focus on high-level strategy, logistics, and resource management. They are generally often split into two major sub-genres: turn-based and real-time, although there are several strategy sub-genres that include extra components such as tactics, diplomacy, economy, and exploration. {% include refpointer.html id=10 %}

#### Sports games

Sports games are recreations of physical sports. Tennis, football, boxing, and motor racing are just a few examples of sports that also exist in video game form. {% include refpointer.html id=11 %}

Some sports games have a focus on actively participating in the sport, while others place an emphasis on strategy and organisation. For humorous effect, some satirise the sport. This genre, like real-world sports, has been popular throughout the history of video games. A number of game series use the names and attributes of real teams and players, and they are updated on a regular basis to match real-world developments. {% include refpointer.html id=11 %}

#### Puzzle games

Puzzle games focus on logical and intellectual obstacles, although they frequently include time-pressure or other action components. Although many action or adventure games include puzzles, such as collecting difficult-to-reach things, a true puzzle game emphasises problem solving as the core gameplay mechanic. Games typically contain shapes, colours, or symbols that the player must manipulate directly or indirectly into a specified pattern. {% include refpointer.html id=12 %}

Puzzle games often show a sequence of similar puzzles that are variations on a same idea. This might entail pattern recognition, logic, or understanding a process. These games often feature a straightforward set of rules in which players manipulate game pieces on a grid, network, or other interaction area. {% include refpointer.html id=12 %}

#### Idle games

In an idle game, players perform basic activities, such as clicking a button, which earns them in-game currency. The currency may be spent to buy equipment or skills that allow the player to acquire the currency more quickly or automatically without having to do the first activity. {% include refpointer.html id=13 %}

A recurring topic is providing the player with sources of money represented by structures such as factories or farms. These sources improve the pace of currency gain, however higher tier sources generally have an exponentially greater cost, therefore upgrading between tiers usually takes the same amount of time or even longer. {% include refpointer.html id=13 %}

This provides an environment with no way to “lose”, low-pressure (as you do not have to play constantly to succeed), and steady progress and feedback, which is ideal for social or mobile play patterns and typically provides high levels of player retention. {% include refpointer.html id=13 %}

### Sub-Genres

Advances in technology and game design have had a significant influence on gaming, creating sub-genres within (frequently overlapping) genres. Some sub-genres can even be seen as sub-genres of sub-genres! {% include refpointer.html id=4 %}

#### Massive Multiplayer Online Game (MMO) / Massive Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game (MMORPG)

An MMO is a game in which many people may play together at the same time over the internet. These games are typically played in a social context, which the user may access after installing the game. {% include refpointer.html id=14 %}

An MMORPG, as the name implies, is a form of MMO which belongs to the [RPG genre](#role-playing-games-rpgs). {% include refpointer.html id=15 %}

By definition, an MMORPG is both an MMO and an RPG, whereas MMOs can be anything from a Battle Royale game to a real-time strategy game, or anything else - as long as it fits the MMO category. {% include refpointer.html id=15 %}

#### Real-time Strategy (RTS)

In Real-time strategy games, players construct troops and defeat their opponents by using resources and skill. Real-time strategy games are usually compared to turn-based strategy games, in which each player has time to carefully consider their next move without being concerned about the moves of their opponent, as each player makes their move on their turn. Real-time strategy games however, allow all players to play simultaneously, with players gathering resources, defending their bases, and launching attacks while being aware that their opponent is doing the same. and may attack at any time. {% include refpointer.html id=16 %}

#### Sandbox

A sandbox game is one in which the player has few constraints, allowing them to freely traverse and modify a virtual world. In contrast to a progression-style game, a sandbox game emphasises exploration and lets the player select tasks. A sandbox game often takes place in a "world" to which the player has total access from beginning to end, rather than separated areas or numbered levels. {% include refpointer.html id=17 %}

Players may choose whether or not to explore structured components of the game, such as mini-games, quests, and storylines. Oftentimes, the non-sequential nature of sandbox games presents game designers with many narrative challenges. As a result, tasks and side-quests often follow a pattern, with tasks unlocking upon successful completion of other objectives. {% include refpointer.html id=17 %}

#### First-Person Shooter (FPS)

A first-person shooter game is played from the protagonist's point of view. during gameplay, the character's arms are normally seen at the bottom of the screen, carrying whatever item is equipped. {% include refpointer.html id=18 %}

Most FPS games have added realism features, such as the rocking of the screen to represent natural human movement, breathing sounds, and footsteps. {% include refpointer.html id=18 %}

#### Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)

A MOBA is a form of highly competitive video game in which two teams of players compete against each other in a battle arena. Each player has control of a single character, each with their own set of talents and skills, and generally, work together to demolish the opponent team's base while defending their own. {% include refpointer.html id=19 %}

The gameplay often includes defeating opponent troops and structures to collect in-game currency, which can then be used to enhance abilities and purchase items. Each player's character has a class, such as a tank, a healer, or an archer, and teams normally include a good mix of these roles to form a balanced lineup. As the game progresses, team fights become more intense and players become stronger, leading to an exciting and challenging gaming experience. {% include refpointer.html id=19 %}

They require players to think on their feet, work together with their team, and make quick decisions, making them an engaging and immersive gaming experience. {% include refpointer.html id=19 %}

#### Battle Royale

A battle royale game is a type of online multiplayer game that features last-man-standing gameplay with certain aspects of a survival game, such as exploration and scavenging. Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players who start with limited equipment and must eliminate all opponents while avoiding getting trapped outside of a diminishing "safe region." The winner is the last player or team standing. {% include refpointer.html id=20 %}

#### Action-Adventure

As the name suggests, action-adventure games combine features from both action games and adventure games. They involve physical skills commonly seen in action games, but also include narrative elements such as compelling storylines, multiple characters, dialogue, and an inventory system that are typically found in adventure games. As a result, playing action-adventure games presents the player with both combat and logic-testing challenges. The gameplay in action-adventure games is typically more intense than pure adventure games, and players typically control a single avatar as the protagonist. These games can be categorized into different types such as first-person action-adventure, third-person action-adventure, platform-adventure games, stealth games, and survival games. {% include refpointer.html id=21 %}

### Types of Gamer

Research has been done to identify the different types of computer gamers that exist. It found that there were 5 main types, categorisable into “potentially problematic” and “non-problematic”. {% include refpointer.html id=22 %}

#### Recreational Gamer

- Non-problematic
- Has low impulsivity
- Has high self-esteem
- Generally spends less time gaming overall
- Finds gaming more of a hobby and not something they _have_ to do
- Gaming is just an activity that they enjoy

#### Social Gamer

- Non-problematic
- Has low impulsivity
- May have low self-esteem
- Plays for the social experience and role-playing potential
- Doesn't find themselves needing to play out of compulsion
- Likely enjoys creating virtual characters but not as a means to replace their real-life identity

#### The ‘Escaper’

- Potentially Problematic
- Seeks to relieve negative mood states through gaming
- Highly motivated by immersive gameplay for its escapism
- May have poor self-esteem
- Less sensation-seeking
- Highly impulsive traits
- Gaming may be as a means to cope with real-life difficulties
- Gaming behaviour may be due to underlying conditions

#### The ‘Achiever’

- Potentially Problematic
- Highly impulsive
- Generally sensation-seeking
- Low self-control
- High self esteem
- Posesses a drive to achieve
- Seeks to progress in the game
- Less interested in role-playing, socialising & escaping
- Has trouble overcoming the immediate gratification provided by the game
- Probably do not play to achieve an idealised sense of self
- Playing because they want to master the game

#### Hardcore Gamer

- Potentially Problematic
- Combination of The ‘Escaper’ and The ‘Achiever’
- Motivated by achievement, sensation-seeking & role-playing
- May have low self-esteem
- Prone to fully identifying and defining themselves through their gaming even in their real life

However, it should be noted that the reasearch mentioned that it is possible for some people to possess traits of multiple gamer types, and essentially be a “hybrid” type. {% include refpointer.html id=22 %}

### Technology

#### Integrated Services

Integrated services and multiplayer settings are critical components of today's video gaming experience. These services let gamers to communicate with one another, play together, and access a variety of gaming material. Some of the most popular video game integrated services and multiplayer environments are:

- **Steam:** Steam is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation. It offers a wide range of games, both single-player and multiplayer, and provides features such as in-game chat, cloud saves, and social networking. Steam also includes a marketplace where players can buy and sell in-game items. {% include refpointer.html id=23 %}
- **PlayStation Plus:** PlayStation Plus is a paid subscription service that provides users with access to premium features. These features include online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and free monthly game downloads. The "Extra" and "Premium" tiers provide access to a wider catalogue of games and additional features such as downloadable games, limited trials of select games, and cloud streaming of games. All tiers of subscription offer the Game Help feature, which provides spoiler-free hints and tips while playing supported games. {% include refpointer.html id=24 %}
- **Apple Arcade:** Apple Arcade is a game subscription service established by Apple for their own devices. It provides a carefully chosen selection of games for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS devices. Multiplayer games are also available in Apple Arcade, allowing people to play together on the same device or online. It provides continuous, unintrusive experiences by omitting practises associated with popular, largely free-to-play, mobile games, such as in-app purchases and adverts. {% include refpointer.html id=25 %}
- **Xbox Network:** Xbox Network is an online gaming and content distribution service for Xbox consoles. It offers multiplayer games, downloadable demos, trailers, and full games through Xbox Live Arcade. Users can choose a gamertag, create friends lists, and play with real-life friends or new people online. Xbox Live Gold is a subscription-based service that can be purchased for one month, three months, or one year. It offers two levels of service, with the free level, called Xbox Live Silver, providing access to Xbox Marketplace downloads, app usage, and chat features. However, Xbox Live Gold is required to play most games online. Xbox Network requires an Xbox console and broadband internet. {% include refpointer.html id=26 %}

In addition to these, many video games also offer their own integrated multiplayer environments. These environments may range from relatively simple such as Minecraft's text-chat-only in-game chat, to more complex features, like full on voice chat in Team Fortress 2. Games such as these often have large playerbases who connect with each other and play together regularly, often forming into smaller communities.

Overall, integrated services and multiplayer environments are essential components of the modern video gaming experience. They allow players to connect with each other and access a wide range of gaming content, creating a rich and vibrant gaming culture.

#### Security Issues

With the inclusion of such services, game developers have had to put systems in place that ensure a fair and welcoming space for everyone. This may be by creating filters that prevent certain words from appearing in messages, by implementing a banning feature that allows repeat offenders to be removed from the platform, and so on.

There are also new security risks being exposed by computer games. A report by SecurityHQ states that “there has been a monumental surge in targeted cyber-attacks against the gaming sector, with a 167% increase in web application attacks in 2021 alone”. Of course, as the industry grows, the motivation for a successful attack grows with it. {% include refpointer.html id=27 %}

A recent example is _Minecraft_ and the Log4Shell vulnerability. Log4Shell was discovered by Chen Zhaojun of the Alibaba Cloud Security Team, and is the name given to a zero-day vulnerability in Log4j, a popular logging framework for the Java programming language. _Minecraft: Java Edition_ is developed in the Java programming language, and uses Log4j, and as such, was affected by this vulnerability. {% include refpointer.html id=28 %} {% include refpointer.html id=29 %}

The official article on the Minecraft Help website stated that “This exploit affects many services - including \_Minecraft: Java Edition\_”. Their response to the situation was swift and well-handled, providing a fix for all affected versions of the game. {% include refpointer.html id=29 %}

Other issues that game developers have to worry about are social exploitation, such as phishing, in their in-game chats. Similarly, American game publisher 2K recently had their helpdesk compromised, and had malicious content sent out to their customers. {% include refpointer.html id=27 %}

### Game Production

There are various ways that game development can be funded, whether by mainstream developers and publishers, such as Valve, Blizzard, or Rockstar, by independent (indie) developers, via crowdfunding such as Kickstarter, by making the game paid, or by making it free to play, with in-app-purchases (IAPs). {% include refpointer.html id=30 %}

### Devices Used & Hardware

Throughout the history of gaming, the industry has seen many changes and advancements. From the early days of computer games to the modern era of virtual reality and eSports, gaming has evolved and expanded in countless ways.

The early days of gaming in the 1960s and 1970s saw the development of games played on mainframe computers using teletype machines or early terminals. These games, such as _Spacewar!_ and _Hunt the Wumpus_, were the first of their kind and set the stage for the industry to come.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the first home gaming consoles were introduced, including the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision. These consoles allowed players to connect to their TV and play simple games like _Pong_, _Space Invaders_, and _Pac-Man_ from the comfort of their own homes.

The 1980s saw the rise of personal computers, which quickly became a popular gaming platform. Popular games from this era include titles like _Ultima_, _Zork_, and _King's Quest_.

The 1990s brought about the rise of gaming consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Sony PlayStation, which saw the introduction of iconic franchises like _Super Mario Bros._, _Sonic the Hedgehog_, and _Final Fantasy_. This era also saw the continuation of PC gaming alongside consoles.

The early 2000s saw the rise of online gaming and multiplayer games, with popular titles like _Club Penguin_, _World of Warcraft_, and _Counter-Strike_. Consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation 2 also began to support online play.

The 2010s marked the explosion of mobile gaming thanks to the widespread adoption of smartphones and tablets. Games like _Angry Birds_, _Candy Crush_, and _Pokémon Go_ became massively popular, making gaming more accessible to a wider audience.

Today, virtual reality gaming and esports are becoming more and more popular. VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and Valve Index allow players to fully immerse themselves in virtual worlds, while eports tournaments and leagues draw millions of viewers worldwide. Gaming continues to evolve and expand, and it will be exciting to see what the future holds for this industry.

#### Hardware

The first computer games were hard-coded into a system, and each console played one game. After a few years - around the mid 70s, the idea of a swappable “game cartridge” started to gain popularity. {% include refpointer.html id=31 %} {% include refpointer.html id=32 %}

In the 1980s, the video game market crashed, due to the oversaturation of the market with low-quality games - which lasted a few years. {% include refpointer.html id=32 %}

A few years later, the gaming market went mobile, with the introduction of handheld devices such as the Game Boy. {% include refpointer.html id=32 %} These consoles allowed for interchangeable cartridges to load different games, and for portability so people could play games on the go! {% include refpointer.html id=32 %} By 1988 the crash was a mere memory, and global games revenues returned to over $20 billion per year! It was during this time that franchises such as Mario, Zelda, and Street Fighter began to emerge. {% include refpointer.html id=32 %}

In 1994, the personal computer was becoming increasingly common in US households, with an estimated 24 million homes (27% of households) owning one. And while PCs were initially viewed as tools for work and productivity, they quickly became popular for their gaming capabilities. In fact, nearly half of all PC owners (48%) played games on their computer. {% include refpointer.html id=32 %}

One reason for the popularity of the PC was its versatility. In addition to gaming, PCs offered other utilities like web browsing and document processing, and as technology continued to advance, PCs began to incorporate new features like CD-ROM drives (that were found in 35% of US households) and sound cards (in 20% of US households). {% include refpointer.html id=32 %}

The launch of the first popular 3D game, Doom, in 1993 further solidified the PC's position as a premier gaming platform. Doom was a groundbreaking first-person shooter that pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the gaming world. It went on to influence not only subsequent shooter games but video gaming as a whole. And it was so successful that it was eventually made available on nearly every video gaming system. {% include refpointer.html id=32 %}

One of the key features of Doom was its multiplayer mode, which allowed players to compete against one another online. This was a major breakthrough at the time and helped to establish the first-person shooter genre as we know it today. {% include refpointer.html id=32 %}

In fact, the Doom Engine (the game engine created to power Doom) was used to base the Quake Engine on (the game engine created to power Quake). Games developer and publisher Valve then created the GoldSrc engine from this, which over time evolved into the Source engine, then into the Source 2 Engine. {% include refpointer.html id=33 %} {% include refpointer.html id=34 %} {% include refpointer.html id=35 %} {% include refpointer.html id=36 %} {% include refpointer.html id=37 %}

The GoldSrc, Source, and Source 2 engines were used to create highly popular games such as Half-Life, Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, Portal, Left 4 Dead, The Stanley Parable (originally as a Half-Life mod), and Dota! {% include refpointer.html id=38 %} All these games (and more) effectively exist because of Doom's underlying technology!

The popularity of PC gaming led to the formation of a dedicated community of gamers. And while there was some overlap with console gamers, the two communities generally remained distinct. Even today, the debate over which platform is better rages on. {% include refpointer.html id=32 %}

## Current Technologies in Gaming

There are various technologies available in the gaming industry, from hardware - the physical parts of a device, software - the programs that run on a device, to game engines - the platforms upon which games can be built. It's important to keep up-to-date with all the latest options as outdated hardware and software may be incompatible with newer games, and they may run slower or even not run at all!

### Hardware Options

#### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the main component of a computer system that handles the majority of the processing work. It is frequently referred to as the "brains" of a computer, as it interprets and executes that instructions that make up software, and coordinates the work of other components.

In a gaming system, the CPU is crucial in determining a system's overall performance. It is in charge of processes such as game logic, physics computations, and artificial intelligence algorithms. The more powerful and quicker the CPU, the better the system will be able to manage these duties and give a smooth and responsive gaming experience. If the CPU is not up to the task, you may experience lag or low frames-per-second (FPS) when playing.

The CPU is also responsible for managing the data flow between the graphics card and other components of the system. This means that a powerful CPU is essential for avoiding bottlenecks and ensuring that the graphics card is able to operate at its full potential. In short, the CPU is a crucial component of a gaming system and plays a critical role in ensuring that the system can handle the demands of modern games.

As of writing (March 2023), the highest ranking CPUs as according to Tom's Hardware are (in no particular order): {% include refpointer.html id=39 %}

As you can see, AMD and Intel have cornered the market for CPUs, and, in fact, are pretty much the only two companies in the business - especially for consumer devices.

#### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

The GPU is a specialised processor that is designed to handle the complex mathematical calculations required for rendering high-quality graphics, to the screen.

In gaming, the GPU plays a crucial role by generating pixels that are displayed on the screen. The CPU runs the game logic and sends any visual data to the GPU, which then takes care of converting this raw data into pixels that appear on screen.

The more powerful the GPU, the more complex and detailed the graphics can be. This can result in smoother gameplay, higher frame rates, and more realistic visuals. Gamers often invest in high-end GPUs to get the best gaming experience possible.

As of writing, according to TechRadar, some of the best GPUs are (in no particula): {% include refpointer.html id=46 %}

As you can see - AMD and Nvidia are the two main competitors in the GPU field.

### Memory (RAM)

RAM (Random Access Memory, or just Memory) is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data and instructions that are actively being used by the computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit). RAM is a crucial component of a computer's architecture and is responsible for providing fast access to data and instructions that are currently in use, as opposed to slower storage devices like hard drives or SSDs.

In gaming, RAM plays an important role in ensuring smooth gameplay by allowing the computer to store and access large amounts of game data quickly. When you launch a game, the game's data is loaded into RAM, from storage, so that it can be accessed quickly by the CPU when needed. This includes things like the game's graphics, sound effects, music, and other game assets.

Having enough RAM is important for gaming, as it allows the computer to run the game smoothly without stuttering or freezing. This is because is takes noticably longer to load data from storage instead of memory. The amount of RAM required for gaming depends on the specific game you are playing, as well as the overall configuration of your computer. Generally speaking, most modern games require at least 8GB of RAM, although some games may require more. If you have an insufficient amount of memory, your computer may struggle to keep up with the demands of the game, resulting in a suboptimal gaming experience.

As according to IGN, some of the best memory is: {% include refpointer.html id=47 %}
